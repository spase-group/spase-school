			The SPASE (Space Physics Archive Search and Extract) Data Model is a set of terms and values
			along with the relationships between them that allow describing all the resources in a heliophysics
			data environment. It is the result of many years of effort by an international collaboration (see
			http://spase-group.org) to unify and improve on existing Space and Solar Physics data models. The
			intent of this Data Model is to provide the means to describe resources, most importantly
			scientifically useful data products, in a uniform way so they may be easily registered, found,
			accessed, and used.
		</p>
		<p>
			The SPASE data model divides the heliophysics data environment into a limited set of resources
			types. A key resource type is Numerical Data. This type of resource typically consists of a set of
			files containing values of one or more physical variables and that differ from each other only by
			the time span. To full describe a Numerical Data resource requires other types of Resources,
			namely Observatory, Instrument, Person, and Repository, whose names are self-explanatory, and
			each of which has its own set of attributes. Often, numerical data are presented in prepared
			images (gif or jpeg), and such presentations are referred to as Display Data resources. The other
			data related resource types are Catalog which are lists of events; Annotation which enable expert
			comments on data products; and Granule which describe individual files within another resource
			(i.e., Numerical Data, Display Data or Catalog). Other types of resources include Document
			which can contain narratives or supporting information; Service that provide software to use data
			resources; Repository for storage locations; and Registry for metadata collections. Resource
			descriptions and the links in them are intended to make the Resource useful to scientific users.

			The SPASE Data Model will only be described briefly here. The document defining the SPASE Data Model as well
			as supporting information about it may be found at the <a href="http://spase-group.org/data">SPASE web site</a>. The model is broken down into a number of
			main elements known as Resource Types, each defining a main topic of data description. The Resource Types are
			presently:
			</p>
			<p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Annotation</dt><dd>Explanatory or descriptive information that is associated with another resource.</dd>
				<dt>Catalog</dt><dd>Listing of events or observational notes.</dd>
				<dt>Document</dt><dd>Plain or formatted text that may include graphics, sound, other multimedia data, or hypermedia references.</dd>
				<dt>Display Data</dt><dd>A graphical representation of data.</dd>
				<dt>Numerical Data</dt><dd>Data product stored as numerical values in a specified format.</dd>
				<dt>Granule</dt><dd>An accessible portion of another resource.</dd>
				<dt>Instrument</dt><dd>A device that is used to sense and parameterize a physical phenomenon.</dd>
				<dt>Observatory</dt><dd>The host (spacecraft, network, facility) for instruments making observations.</dd>
				<dt>Person</dt><dd>An individual human being.</dd>
				<dt>Registry</dt><dd>A location or facility where resources are catalogued.</dd>
				<dt>Repository</dt><dd>A location or facility where resources are stored.</dd>
				<dt>Service</dt><dd>A location or facility that can perform a well-defined task.</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of these elements is broken down into sub-elements that provide sufficient detail for adequate description of data
			sets. The Resource Types Numerical Data, Display Data and Catalogue are the resources used to describe
			Heliophysics data products. These data product descriptions reference the other resources which contain descriptions
			of the observatories, instruments, people, etc. that created the data products. The resources are described using the
			terms from the SPASE Data Dictionary presented in the Data Model document.

           SPASE provides a number of services and protocols which work with SPASE descriptions (XML documents that conform to the SPASE metadata schema).
           Here are those available from the SPASE Group web site.
